# Mimikatz Security Research & Analysis

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT LEGAL AND ETHICAL NOTICE**
> 
> This repository is for **EDUCATIONAL, DEFENSIVE SECURITY, and AUTHORIZED RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**. The information and tools referenced here are intended for legitimate security research, penetration testing in authorized environments, and blue team defense development.

## 📋 Research Objectives

### Primary Goals:
- **Understand credential dumping techniques** used by attackers
- **Develop detection signatures** for Mimikatz and similar tools
- **Analyze behavioral patterns** of credential theft attacks
- **Create mitigation strategies** for enterprise environments
- **Study Windows security mechanisms** and their limitations

### Defensive Focus:
- YARA rules for static detection
- Sigma rules for SIEM detection
- Behavioral analysis for EDR detection
- Memory forensics techniques
- Prevention and hardening guidance

## 🚨 Usage Warnings & Legal Disclaimer

### ❌ PROHIBITED USES:
- Unauthorized testing on systems you don't own
- Malicious credential theft
- Production environments without explicit authorization
- Illegal activities of any kind
- Distribution to unauthorized parties

### ✅ APPROVED USES:
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research in controlled labs
- Blue team defense development
- Academic security courses
- Incident response training

### 🔒 Required Controls:
- Use only in isolated lab environments
- Obtain proper authorization before testing
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with all applicable laws and re# Mimikatz Security Research & Analysis
